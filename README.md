Twist of Fate
=============

An old game that was developed by Luciano Ciccariello (me), Antonio Iacovazzi and Marcello Mancarella for a Computer Science's university exam.

The game was built with Unity 3.5 IIRC and it takes assets from commercial games like Castlevania Symphony of the Night, Castlevania Dawn of Sorrow and Metal Slug XX.

The music was composed and mastered by Antonio Iacovazzi.

This project is here only for portfolio purpose and it is no long maintained in any way.
